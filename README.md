### Hi, I'm Aleksei Aleinikov! 👋

## Introduction

Hey there! I’m Aleksei, a Senior Platform/Cloud Engineer (DevOps/SRE) and Senior Software Engineer with 11+ years of experience designing and operating secure, scalable cloud-native platforms and distributed systems. Currently based in Thessaloniki, Greece, I focus on building **reliable, audit-friendly, and security-first cloud platforms** — with deep hands-on experience on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and solid exposure to **AWS/Azure**.

I work at the intersection of **software engineering** and **platform engineering**: I build delivery foundations (IaC, CI/CD, GitOps), establish operational standards (runbooks, on-call readiness, incident playbooks), and integrate security controls into delivery workflows (vulnerability management, policy enforcement, secrets management, and secure defaults). My goal is to make platforms **safe to operate at scale**, predictable under change, and easy for teams to use without compromising security or velocity.

I value clean architecture, strong engineering culture, and pragmatic enablement practices — the kind that reduce key-person risk and keep systems maintainable over time.

## Strengths 💪

- 🧩 **Platform & Cloud Engineering**
  Build and operate cloud-native platforms with **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, and **GitOps**, focusing on secure-by-default foundations, standardization, and smooth environment promotion.

- 🔐 **Security-First Delivery**
  Embed security into the delivery lifecycle: **secrets management**, policy enforcement, vulnerability workflows, and supply-chain hygiene (scanning, SBOM-minded practices, and repeatable controls).

- 📈 **Reliability & Observability**
  Design operational visibility with **Prometheus/Grafana/ELK**, define practical SLI/SLO expectations, and improve incident response with actionable alerting and clear runbooks.

- ⚙️ **Automation & Enablement**
  Create reusable building blocks (IaC modules, CI templates, deployment patterns) that reduce drift, lower change risk, and help teams ship consistently.

- 🛠️ **Software Engineering Background**
  Strong foundation in **Python**, **Go**, and **JavaScript/TypeScript** with practical experience building services, automations, and developer-facing tooling.

- ☁️ **Cloud Breadth**
  Deep GCP experience with hands-on work across multi-region and multi-cloud environments; strong comfort with IAM, networking patterns, secure service exposure, and cost-aware design.
