### Hi, I'm Aleksei Aleinikov! 👋

## Introduction

Hey there! I’m Aleksei, a Senior Software & DevOps Engineer with 10+ years of experience blending full-stack development, cloud infrastructure design, and automation. Currently based in Thessaloniki, Greece, I focus on building **resilient, cost-efficient, and scalable systems in the cloud — especially on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

In recent years, I’ve shifted from full-stack development toward **DevOps, cloud architecture, and platform engineering**, with a strong emphasis on automation, IaC, and observability. I work hands-on with tools like **Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD, GitLab CI/CD**, and design production-grade infrastructure.

When I’m not working on infrastructure, I write backend services in **Go**, contribute to full-stack projects with **React & Next.js**, and explore new technologies like **Rust** and **machine learning**.

## Strengths 💪

- 🚀 **DevOps & Cloud-Native Engineering**  
  Built scalable multi-region infrastructure on **GCP**, automated deployments via **GitLab CI**, and integrated observability tooling with **Prometheus, Grafana, and Stackdriver**. Reduced costs by 30% and improved uptime to 99.999%.

- ⚙️ **Automation-First Mindset**  
  Used **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and GitOps practices to fully automate deployments and configuration. Enabled auto-scaling, self-healing Kubernetes clusters, and disaster recovery (Warm Standby, Pilot Light).

- 🛠️ **Backend & Full Stack Dev**  
  Strong background in **Python**, **Go**, **Node.js**, and **TypeScript**. Built microservices and APIs, and delivered web apps using **React** and **Next.js** with a focus on performance and UX.

- ☁️ **Cloud Expertise**  
  Deep experience in **Google Cloud Platform**, with hands-on knowledge of AWS and Azure. Skilled in IAM, networking, storage, monitoring, and cost optimization.

- 🧠 **Tech Explorer**  
  Constantly learning — exploring **Rust**, **Swift**, and **LLM tools** on Hugging Face. I love diving into new tech and sharing insights via articles and side projects.
